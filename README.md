# generative_art

This repository contains generative art created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

### Exhibit 1 : [sinusoidal_seven](https://github.com/jiteshpabla/generative_art/blob/master/sinusoidal_seven.js)
My very first generative art features seven blobs that leave a trail in a circular pattern going outwards and inwards following a sinusoidal function.\
It can be viewed on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BygVqI6FpHz/) and [codepen](https://codepen.io/jiteshpabla/pen/VJZYMG) too!
